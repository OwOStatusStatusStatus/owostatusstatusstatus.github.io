It was one hell of a time with everyone that has worked with me, thank you all, it was a pleasure, but as it stands right now I will be retiring. I hope I'm better than it than Wick. To everyone who finds the need to you can still contact me on freenode as ArsenArsen. If you prefer Discord there's an IRC bridge in ShareX Discord where you can highlight me and I'll likely see it.
bye.")
